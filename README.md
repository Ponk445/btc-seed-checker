# About the program

What does the program do? The program is able to get the current prices of cryptocurrencies on the market, as well as analyze its changes in price, which can help for scalping.
It also parses news from popular sources and sends it to you. The program also contains a large database of crypto addresses of whales, which looks at their transactions (what they bought and what they sold), based on which you can decide to buy the same cryptocurrency or sell.
The information is sent to one of the selected messengers (Discord and Telegram).

# Usage
When you start the program for the first time, you will be asked to choose a messenger and enter settings for them (webhook for Discord or token and user id for Telegram). 
After that, the program will start analyzing the above mentioned. When the program finds something interesting, you will receive a message in the messenger with the information.
